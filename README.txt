Zasm 2 is a Zilog z80 assembler written for unixes in C.
It is intended for use for the TI calculators and the
Nintendo Gameboy, if given a different TAB file.

Compile:
 ./configure && make

Install:
 make install
--Or copy the binary to any directory. 
Automake installs it to `/usr/local/bin` and a tab file
to `/usr/local/share/zasm`. Probably need root permissions.

Uninstall:
 rm /usr/local/bin/zasm
 rm -rf /usr/local/share/zasm
